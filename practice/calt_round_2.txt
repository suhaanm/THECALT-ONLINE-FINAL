Define a recursion such that $a_1=1$ and for $n \geq 2$, $a_n = a_{n-1}/3$. Let $r$ be a constant. We define $A(n)$ as the sum of an infinite geometric series with first term $a_n$ and common ratio $r$. If $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A(n)=50,$$ then $r$ can be expressed as $\frac{p}{s}$, where $\gcd(p,s)=1$, find $p+s$.
A regular hexagon and all of its diagonals are drawn. Let the ratio of the smallest region's area to the largest region's area be $m$, where $m$ can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$. Find $a+b$.
Define $s(n)$ as the sum of the digits of $n$. Let $f(n)$ be the least nonnegative integer value of $m$ in $s^{m}(n)$, such that the value of $s^{m}(n)$ is a single digit. For example, $f(47)$ would be $2$, as $s^{2}(47)=2$ but $s^{1}(47)$ is $11$, which is not a single digit and $f(3)=0$. Find $f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+\dots+f(100)$.
Triangle ABC has side lengths $AB = 13$, $AC = 14$, and $BC = 15$. A segment $PQ$ is drawn parallel to $BC$ and tangent to the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ with $P$ on $AB$ and $Q$ on $AC$. If the distance from $P$ to $AC$ can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $\gcd(a,b)=1$, find $a+b$.
If all the ordered pairs $(x,y)$, with $x$ and $y$ positive integers, such that $\text{lcm}(x,y)+\gcd(x,y)=x+y+26$, can be written as $(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),\dots , (x_n,y_n)$, find $x_1+y_1+x_2+y_2+\dots+x_n+y_n$.
A random permutation of the word the word ``caltop" is chosen. The probability that there is at least one string of 4 consecutive letters that is alphabetically ordered can be expressed as $\frac{a}{720}$. Find $a$.
Enter 0 for this problem, since it was scrapped and everyone received free points.
Consider a $2\times 1$ bed. Define $f(n)$ as the amount of $1\times 1$ blocks you need to cover the bed such that you need to break a minimum of $n$ blocks to reach the bed, such that you can't attack from underneath. For example, $f(1)=8$ and a diagram of this is shown. Find $f(100) \mod{1000}$. <br><img src="https://thecalt.com/static/images/round2_p8_diagram.png">
Tony lists all the factors of $105$ in order. Bryan comes along and randomly selects one of the numbers Tony wrote down, then writes down all the numbers from 1 to that number. For example, if Bryan selects the number 15, he would list the numbers from 1 to 15 in order. Mike then chooses an integer $x$ uniformly at random from the ordered list Bryan wrote and then, Carl selects a number $y$ uniformly at random from $1$ to that number $x$ Mike chose. If the expected value of $y$ can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $\gcd(a,b)=1$, find $a+b$.
Find the remainder when $\dbinom{2000}{600} - \dbinom{1000}{200}$ is divided by $16$.
