There are four bookshelves in a small library which are labelled #1, #2, #3, and #4 and they hold $120, 135, 142,$ and $167$ books respectively. A day later, $a$ books have been removed from each shelf. Another day later, $0, b, c,$ and $d$ books have been removed from bookshelves #1, #2, #3, and #4 respectively. At that time, all $4$ shelves have the same number of books remaining. If $b,c,$ and $d$ are positive integers such that $a=b+c+d$, how many books are remaining on Shelf #1?
Suppose rectangle $ABCD$ is located in the first quadrant, so that point $A$ is on the straight line $y=x$, point $B$ is on the curve $y= \frac 1x$ and points $C$ and $D$ are on the x-axis as shown below. If $AB=2BC$, find the area of rectangle $ABCD$. If your answer can be expressed as $\frac pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime, find $10p+q$. <br><img src="https://thecalt.com/static/images/round3_p2_diagram.png">
ATV and Elmo are in a meme competition, and their memes are rated out of 15. Elmo's rating is a random positive integer from $1$ to $15$ inclusive, while ATV gets the ratings $1,2,\dots, 15$ with ratio $1:2:\dots:14:15$ respectively. If the probability that ATV wins the meme competition can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $\gcd(a,b)=1$, find $a+b$. A tie is not a win.
For a real value $x$, $2^{x^3}= 3^{x^4}$, compute the sum of the possible values of $6^{2^{3^x}}$.
Let $f(x)=x^3+9x^2+bx+c$. If the values $9,b,c$ are in an arithmetic sequence and the roots of $f(x)$ are also in an arithmetic sequence, find $b+c$.
Let $o_k(x)$ be the area of the regular polygon with $k$ sides and circumradius $x$. Let $p_k(x)$ be the area of the regular polygon with $k$ sides and side length $x$. If $\frac{o_{12}(1)}{p_{12}(1)}$ can be expressed as $a-\sqrt b$, find $10a+b.$
Let $f_k(n)$ denote the number of solutions $a$ to $a^k \equiv 1 \mod n$ where $a<n$ and $a$ is a nonnegative integer. Compute $$\sum_{p < 100, p \text{ is a prime}} f_7(p).$$
Let $S_{m}$ be the area of the triangular region that is enclosed by the straight lines \begin{align*}l_1: y=mx+2(m-1) \\ l_2: y= (m+1)x+2m \\ l_3: y=0 \end{align*} for all $m=1, 2, 3, \dots$. Find the value of $S_1+S_2+\dots+S_{2020} + S_{2021}.$ If your answer can be expressed as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $\gcd(p,q)=1$, find $p+q$.
Dan, Emily and Fiona are painters. Dan can paint a wall in $d$ hours, Emily can paint the same wall in $e$ hours and Fiona can paint the same wall in $\frac{2021}{2020}$ hours. Since Dan and Emily are jealous of Fiona, they decide to work together on a wall and finish it before or at the same time at which Fiona can complete hers, so they can get rid of their jealousy. Given that $d$ and $e$ are positive integers lesser than $50$ find the number of ordered pairs $( d,e)$ that make Dan and Emily NOT get rid of their jealousy.
As shown in the diagram below, $O$ is the center of a regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ where $OM \perp ED$ at $M$ and $ON=NM$. If the area of triangle $FAN$ is $10$, find the area of hexagon $ABCDEF.$ <br><img src="https://thecalt.com/static/images/round3_p10_diagram.png">
