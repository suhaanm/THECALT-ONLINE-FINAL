If $n$ is a positive integer such that $n \times 3^5=3^7-3^5$, find $n$.
Given a right triangle with legs of lengths $5$ and $6$, a square is drawn with one side as its hypotenuse such that the triangle is completely inside the square. Find the area of the region inside the square but outside the triangle.
Let $f(x) = x^2-x-3$ and $g(x)=2x+3$ for all real numbers $x$. Find the absolute value of the sum of all real values of $x$ such that $f(g(x)) = g(f(x))$.
In regular hexagon $ABCDEF$, diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BF}$ intersect at a point $G$. If the area of $\triangle ABG$ is $2$, find the area of pentagon $CDEFG$.
Let $b>6$ be an integer. There exist base-$b$ and base-$(b+1)$ numbers such that$$8\gcd(600_b, 660_b) = 45\gcd(100_{b+1}, 110_{b+1}).$$ Find $b$.
$8$ people randomly split into $2$ groups of four to dance. After that, the $8$ people randomly split into $4$ pairs of two to talk. The probability that exactly $2$ of the $4$ pairs contain two people who have danced in the same group of four is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$. Find $100m+n$.
In trapezoid $ABCD$ with $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CD}$, $AB=4$, and $AD=BC=5$, let the angle bisector of $\angle ADC$ intersect the diagonal $\overline{AC}$ at a point $P$. If line $BP$ intersects the side $\overline{CD}$ at a point $Q$ such that $CQ=8$, find the area of trapezoid $ABCD$.
Richard thinks of a positive integer $n$ and writes the base ten representations of $n!$ and $(n+1)!$ on a board. He then erases the zeroes to the right of the last nonzero digit of each number (if any exist), resulting in two numbers $a$ and $b$. If one of $a$ and $b$ is $4$ times the other, find the sum of all possible values of $n$ less than $1000$.
Let $ABC$ be a right triangle with right angle at $A$ and side lengths $AC=8$ and $BC=16$. The lines tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ at points $A$ and $B$ intersect at $D$. Let $E$ be the point on side $\overline{AB}$ such that $\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{CE}$. Then $DE^2$ can be written as $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $100m+n$.
Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial with degree $3$ and real coefficients such that the coefficient of the $x^3$ term is $1$, and $P(x)$ has roots $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy$$-\frac{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}{2022} = abc=2021.$$Find the minimum possible value of $|P(1)|$.
