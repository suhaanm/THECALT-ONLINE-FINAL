$5$ people are playing catch. Anna starts with the ball. Anna, Bob, Carl, and Diana will pass to everyone except for Earl, but Earl will pass to everyone. Compute the number of ways for Carl to have the ball after $3$ throws.
Timmy's teacher tells him to find the area of a triangle with 2 of the sides being $6,4$ and one angle is $30^{\circ}$. Timmy tells the teacher that there are many triangles with this condition, so he tells Timmy that the $30^{\circ}$ angle is adjacent to the side with length $6$ but not to the side with length $4$. Timmy goes back, and then again realizes there is more than one triangle that can be formed. This time, he finds the sum of both areas instead of asking the teacher. Timmy gets the correct answer and expresses it as $a\sqrt{b}$ with $b$ squarefree and $a,b$ being positive integers. Find $a+b$.
A finite number of rectangles are placed side by side so the bases align. The first is a $1\times1$, the second is a $1\times2$, the third is a $2\times 2$, the fourth is a $2\times3$, and the pattern continues, we add $1$ to the second dimension and then a $1$ to the first. If $n$ is the greatest number of rectangles we can place so that the perimeter is less than $2000$, what is the perimeter when we place $n$ rectangles? An example for 4 rectangles is shown below, where the perimeter is $18$. <br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gkEFoWQ.png" width="200"><br>
How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ exist such that $$\frac{\text{lcm}(x,y)}{\gcd(x,y)} = x, x \leq 100, y\leq 100 ?$$
Triangle $ABC$ has side length $AB = 10, AC = 6, BC=  8$. Segments $DE, FG$ are drawn such that $E,F$ lie on $AB$, $D$ on $AC$, $G$ on $BC$, $DE || FG$, $FG \perp AB$, and the triangle $ABC$ is divided into three regions of equal area. If $EF$ can be expressed as $\frac{a-b\sqrt c}{d},$ where $c$ is squarefree and $\gcd(a,b,d)=1$, find $a+b+c+d.$
Find the number of ordered pairs $(m,n)$ of positive integers $m\neq n$ less than $2021$ that satisfy $$m^{\gcd(m,20)} = n^{\gcd(n,21)}.$$
The minimum value of $\displaystyle x^{2} y^{2} -2x^{2} y-2xy^{2} +xy+x^{2} +y^{2} +x+y+1$ can be expressed as $\displaystyle \frac{m}{n}$, for relatively prime positive integers $m,n$. Find $\displaystyle m+n$.
For integers $n>0$, let $$a_n = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2n-1}\sqrt{i^2+9i+20}}{n} \right\rfloor.$$ $$S_n = \sum_{j=1}^n a_j.$$ What is the least integer $k$ such that $S_k>2022$?
Define $\displaystyle d( n)$ as the number of positive divisors of $\displaystyle n$. A positive integer $\displaystyle k\leq 100$ is called <i>balanced</i> if $$d( k) +d( 3k) =2\cdotp d( 2k) .$$ Find the number of <i>balanced</i> integers.
19 coins are flipped and $n$ of them are heads. The probability that if we flip the 19 coins again, we get at least $n$ heads, is $p$. If $p$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{2^k},$ where $m,k$ are positive integers such that $m$ is odd find the remainder when $m+k$ is divided by 100.
